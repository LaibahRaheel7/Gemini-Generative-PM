## Tips for Writing Good Requirements

1. **Be Specific**: Mention technologies, frameworks, and tools
2. **Break It Down**: Separate backend, frontend, infrastructure tasks
3. **Include Team Info**: List available team members and their roles
4. **Set Dependencies**: Mention what depends on what (e.g., "frontend needs API first")
5. **Be Realistic**: Don't pack 6 months of work into 2 weeks
6. **Add Context**: Explain the "why" when it helps with task sizing
